# Retro Harbour
Retro Harbout is a collection of handcrafted pre-configured environments for retro console development.

Our Goal is to safeguard these platforms by making it extra simple to develop for them.

Check the list below to see the list of current available platforms.

**Why?**

Did you ever wanted to develop for these consoles that made your youth, and got demoralized from the lack of resources or the complexity of getting the toolchain running?  
Retro Harbour is an answer to that problem. By providing ready to use containers, we hope to lower the barrier to entry!

**How?**

Retro Harbour is built around the now ubiquitous docker technology for contenarization. To learn more about that technology, please check the vendor's documentations. Providing containers also allows you to integrate these images into your CI pipeline for an added touch of modernity.

**Contribute?**

We are open to contribution, feel free to submit a pull request with the system of your choice. Please bear in mind that the focus of this project is to keep the footprint small.  
Missing a system? You can also submit a request!
